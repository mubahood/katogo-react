# Connect Profile System - Final Polish Complete ✨

## 🎯 Issues Addressed

### 1. **Avatar Sizing & Balance**
**Problem:** Avatars were too large and unbalanced on both profile details page and user listings

**Solutions Applied:**
- **Profile Page Avatar:** Reduced from 160px → 120px
- **Medium Avatar (Listings):** Reduced from 64px → 56px  
- **Large Avatar:** Reduced from 100px → 80px
- **XLarge Avatar:** Reduced from 150px → 120px
- **Initials Font Sizes:** Proportionally reduced to match new avatar sizes
  - Small: 16px (unchanged)
  - Medium: 24px → 22px
  - Large: 36px → 32px
  - XLarge: 54px → 48px

**Result:** ✅ Much more balanced and professional appearance across all views

---

### 2. **Age Display Logic**
**Problem:** Age could show as "0" or invalid values

**Solutions Applied:**
- **Validation Rule:** Age must be ≥ 10 years to display, otherwise show "N/A"
- **Applied Everywhere:**
  - ✅ Profile details page
  - ✅ User card list variant
  - ✅ User card grid variant  
  - ✅ User card swipe variant

**Examples:**
```typescript
// Before (could show "0 yrs")
{user.age && user.age > 0 && <span>{user.age} yrs</span>}

// After (shows N/A for invalid ages)
<span>{user.age && user.age >= 10 ? `${user.age} yrs` : 'N/A'}</span>
```

**Result:** ✅ Clean, professional age display with proper validation

---

### 3. **Field Name Corrections**
**Problem:** Some fields used incorrect property names from the ConnectUser interface

**Fixes Applied:**
- ❌ `user.education` → ✅ `user.education_level`
- ❌ `user.relationship_status` → ✅ `user.looking_for` (more appropriate)
- ❌ `user.hometown` → ✅ Combined `city, state, country`

**Result:** ✅ No TypeScript errors, proper data display
