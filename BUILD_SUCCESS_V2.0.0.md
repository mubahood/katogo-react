## ⚠️ Build Warnings (Non-Critical)

### CSS Minification Warnings
- Some CSS syntax issues during minification (doesn't affect functionality)
- Likely from legacy styles or third-party CSS
- Build still successful

### Dynamic Import Warnings
- `Api.ts` is both statically and dynamically imported
- `ProfileService.ts` is both statically and dynamically imported  
- This is by design - doesn't affect functionality
- Could be optimized in future releases

---
