2. `Hey! I saw your profile and thought we might have a lot in common`
3. `Hi there! Your profile caught my attention. Would love to chat!`
4. `Hello [Name]! I think we'd get along great. Want to talk?`
5. `Hey! I'm interested in getting to know you better 💬`

### Modal Design:

- **Responsive design** for mobile devices

### User Experience:
- Click suggestion → Instant send

## 4. Technical Improvements

```typescript
const [showChatModal, setShowChatModal] = useState(false);

```

### Benefits:
- Better code organization
- Reusable message sending logic
- Improved error handling
- Better user feedback

### Animation:
```css
@keyframes modalSlideIn {
  from {
    opacity: 0;
    transform: translateY(20px) scale(0.95);
  }
  to {
    opacity: 1;
    transform: translateY(0) scale(1);
  }
}
```
