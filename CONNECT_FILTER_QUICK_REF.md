## ✅ What Was Fixed

### Before ❌

- No visual indicator of active filters

### After ✅
- **Apply Filters button** added
- Filters only apply on button click
- All filters sync with URL
- Filters persist on refresh
- Badge shows active filter count

## 🎮 How It Works Now

### User Experience
```
1. Click "Filters" → Panel opens
2. Select filters (Male, Online Only, etc.)
3. Click "Apply Filters" → Filters applied
4. Badge shows number (e.g., "2")
5. URL updates: /connect?sex=male&online_only=yes&page=1
```

### URL Examples
```
Default:           /connect
Page 2:            /connect?page=2
Male only:         /connect?sex=male
