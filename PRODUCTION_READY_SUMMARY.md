## ⚠️ What Needs Cleanup (Before Production)

### 1. **Console.log Statements** ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY
**Found: 100+ instances**

**Impact:** Not critical, but unprofessional in production

**Solution Provided:**
1. Run cleanup script: `bash cleanup-console-logs.sh`
2. Or use the logger utility: `src/app/utils/logger.ts`

**Example files with console.logs:**
- `ProductDetailPage.tsx` - 10+ logs
- `ModernMainNav.tsx` - 5+ logs
- `MoviesPage.tsx` - 8+ logs
- `LiveSearchBox.tsx` - 15+ logs
- `CustomVideoPlayer.tsx` - 10+ logs

### 2. **Markdown Linting** ℹ️ LOW PRIORITY
**Found:** Minor markdown formatting issues in documentation files

**Impact:** Zero - these are just documentation files

**Action:** Optional - can ignore or auto-fix with `markdownlint --fix`

## 📋 Action Items Before Deployment

### Critical (Must Do)
- [ ] **Remove console.logs** (15 minutes)
  ```bash
