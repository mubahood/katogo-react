# 🚀 SUBSCRIPTION SYSTEM - QUICK START GUIDE

## ⚡ 5-Minute Integration

You're 99% done! Just need to add 3 routes and you're ready to test.

---

## STEP 1: Add Routes (2 minutes)

Open this file:
```
/Users/mac/Desktop/github/katogo-react/src/app/routing/AppRoutes.tsx
```

### Add these imports at the top (around line 50-60):
```typescript
const SubscriptionPlans = React.lazy(() => import("../pages/SubscriptionPlans"));
const PaymentResult = React.lazy(() => import("../pages/PaymentResult"));
const SubscriptionHistory = React.lazy(() => import("../pages/SubscriptionHistory"));
```

### Add these routes in the Routes section (around line 150-200):
```typescript
{/* Subscription Routes */}
<Route 
  path="subscription/plans" 
  element={<SubscriptionPlans />} 
/>

<Route 
  path="subscription/callback" 
  element={<PaymentResult />} 
/>

<Route 
  path="subscription/history" 
  element={
    <ProtectedRoute>
      <SubscriptionHistory />
    </ProtectedRoute>
  } 
/>
```

✅ **That's it for routes!**

---

## STEP 2: Add Widget to Dashboard (1 minute)

Open this file:
```
/Users/mac/Desktop/github/katogo-react/src/app/pages/account/AccountDashboard.tsx
```
or
```
/Users/mac/Desktop/github/katogo-react/src/app/pages/account/AccountDashboardNew.tsx
```

### Add import at the top:
```typescript
import SubscriptionWidget from "../components/subscription/SubscriptionWidget";
```

### Add widget in the JSX (at the top of dashboard content):
```typescript
<div className="dashboard-section">
  <SubscriptionWidget />
</div>
```

✅ **Dashboard widget added!**

---

## STEP 3: Test It! (2 minutes)

### Start your React app:
```bash
cd /Users/mac/Desktop/github/katogo-react
npm start
```

### Visit the subscription page:
```
http://localhost:3000/subscription/plans
```

### You should see:
- ✅ 3 subscription plans with beautiful cards
- ✅ Language switcher (English/Luganda/Swahili)
- ✅ Prices and features
- ✅ "Subscribe Now" buttons
